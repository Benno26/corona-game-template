Corona Game Template
(c) 2011 by Radamanthus Batnag

This is a template project for building games using Ansca Mobile's Corona SDK (http://www.anscamobile.com/corona/)

USAGE
Out of the box, this is a working Corona project. It includes a splash screen (loadmenu.lua, displays images/splashScreen.png for 1 second) and the following menu buttons:
- Play
- Settings
- Help
- About

The images for the buttons are loaded from images/buttons. Note the naming convetion: play.png is the button for Play, settings.png for Settings, etc.

The project includes a Ruby script, generate.rb, for automatically generating your own menu code from the menu.json file.
To be able to run generate.rb, you need Ruby 1.9.2 or MacRuby with the JSON gem installed.
To run generate.rb, just invoke it from a Terminal while in the project's root directory:
ruby generate.rb (for Ruby 1.9.2), or
macruby generate.rb (for MacRuby)

You don't need to include generate.rb and menu.json when you deploy your Corona project.
