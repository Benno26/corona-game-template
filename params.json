{"body":"This is a template project for building games using [Corona SDK](http://www.coronalabs.com)\r\n\r\n## Note to previous users\r\n\r\nThis project has been updated to use the Storyboard API. You can find the old version, which uses Director, in the 1.0 branch.\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\nOut of the box, this is a working Corona project. It includes a splash screen (loadmenu.lua) which displays images/splash_screen.png for 1 second and then displays the main menu (menu.lua) with the following buttons:\r\n- Play\r\n- Settings\r\n- Help\r\n- About\r\n\r\nNote the naming convention for button images:\r\nThe buttons for Play are btn_play.png and btn_play_over.png; the buttons for Settings are btn_settings.png and btn_settings_over.png, etc.\r\n\r\nIf you have Ruby 1.9.3 installed, my Ruby gem [nakor](http://github.com/radamanthus/nakor) provides an easy command-line interface to generating apps from this template.\r\n\r\n# Credits\r\n\r\nThis code is MIT licensed, see http://developer.coronalabs.com/code/license\r\n","google":"UA-33222743-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
